📝 Overview
String manipulation is a fundamental skill in Java programming. Whether you’re working with text data, developing algorithms, or preparing for coding interviews, string operations are indispensable. This repository contains a range of problems, from basic to intermediate, to help you practice Java string manipulation on a daily basis.

🚀 Getting Started
1.Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code

2.Open the project in an IDE like STS, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support.
Make sure you have Java JDK 8 or later installed.
3.Start Practicing

📅 Daily Practice
Each folder in the src directory represents a new daily problem. Here’s how the structure works:

1.Read the Problem Statement: Each day’s folder contains a README.md file explaining the problem.
2.Write the Code: Implement your solution in the corresponding .java file.
3.Run Tests:

Example Problems
Day 1: Reverse a string (Day1_ReverseString.java)
Day 2: Check if a string is a palindrome (Day2_PalindromeCheck.java)
Day 3: Find the most common character in a string (Day3_MostCommonCharacter.java)
Day 4: Count vowels and consonants (Day4_VowelConsonantCounter.java)
Day 5: Remove duplicate characters from a string (Day5_RemoveDuplicates.java)
And many more to come!

Happy Coding in Java!
